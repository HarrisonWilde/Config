Need to recover the `lib/python3.8/site-packages/pygments/styles` file from the `miniconda3` dir and transfer across to get custom styles for the Radian r console.

Use `.transferdotfiles` and the following instructions to transfer to new computer
1. Create alias to ensure that the git bare repository works without problem.
2. Reload the shell setting to use that alias.
3. Add .dotfiles.git directory to .gitignore to prevent recursion issues.
4. Clone the repo.
5. Check if it works fine.
6. If you already have configuration files with identical names, checkout will fail. Back up and remove those files. Skip back up if you donâ€™t need them.
7. Prevent untracked files from showing up on dotfiles status.
