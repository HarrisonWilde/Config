Use EventScripts with an AppleScript containing:

do shell script "/Users/harrisonwilde/miniforge3/bin/python /Users/harrisonwilde/.config/darkmodeswitcher/switch_mode.py >> /Users/harrisonwilde/.config/darkmodeswitcher/out.log"

Make it run whenever either of the following two events occur
    1. Screen password unlocked
    2. EventScripts launched (otherwise won't work on boot)
